Understanding how associative learning occurs in the brain is one of the most important questions in neuroscience. One of the key concepts in associative learning relates to the idea of a prediction error â€” a mismatch between what we expect to happen and what actually happens. Both humans and animals use prediction errors to learn; the greater the error, the greater the learning. Prediction errors can be calculated using the...
