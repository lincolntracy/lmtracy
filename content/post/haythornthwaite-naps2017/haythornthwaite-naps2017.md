In June 2017, I attended the [North American Pain School](http://northamericanpainschool.com/) and served as a PRF-NAPS Correspondent. Through the NAPS' partnership with [Pain Research Forum](http://www.painresearchforum.org/), I received unique science communication training from [Christine Chambers](https://twitter.com/DrCChambers) (Dalhousie University) and [Neil Andrews](https://www.painresearchforum.org/about/prf-team) (Pain Research Forum).

As part of the PRF-NAPS Correspondent program, I interviewed **Jennifer Haythornthwaite**, PhD, from the [Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/psychiatry/index.html) and the [Center for Mind-Body Research](https://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-center-for-mind-body-research/index.html) at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, US. During the interview we discussed her path to clinical psychology, and her perspective on the role of catastrophising in pain.
