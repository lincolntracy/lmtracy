The North American Pain School (NAPS) is an educational initiative of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) and the Analgesic, Anaesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION) partnership, presented by the Quebec Pain Research Network.

Each year, NAPS brings leading experts in the field of pain research and management together with 30 trainees to provide a unique educational and networking experience at the incredible Chateau Montebello (approximately ninety minutes out of Montreal).

The first NAPS intake (2016) consisted solely of trainees from the northern hemisphere. Subsequent years however, have included an Australian flavour, with Lincoln Tracy and Anne Burke (APS President Elect) invited to attend in 2017 and 2018, respectively.

During my time at NAPS I served as a [PRF-NAPS Correspondent](https://northamericanpainschool.com/prf-naps-correspondents/), where I received unique science communication training from Neil Andrews (IASP PRF Executive Editor) and Christine Chambers (NAPS Assistant Director). If you are a postgrad student or clinical trainee with an interest in writing and science communication then I would *definitely* recommend indicating this interest in the relevant section of your application. 

I have written about my [interview with Jennifer Haythornthwaite](https://www.lincolntracy.com/post/haythornthwaite-naps2017/) on an eailer post, otherwise you can check out Pain Research Forum for [other interviews from NAPS](https://www.painresearchforum.org/forums/interview).
