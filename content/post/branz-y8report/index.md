Since July 2017 I have worked as a Research Fellow in the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/), with a particular focus on the Burns Registry of Australia and New Zealand ([BRANZ](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/branz)). In addition to undertaking [research into burn injuries](/project/burn-injuries/), I assist in overseeing the collection of epidemiological data on all burn patients admitted to BRANZ hospitals. Each year the BRANZ releases a report, which assists in monitoring burn injury incidence and improving our understanding of burn causation.

The eighth Annual Report from the BRANZ provides valuable information on the incidence and aetiology of burn injury across Australia and New Zealand. Data are presented for 3,295 burns patients treated at 17 specialist burn units over the 12-month period from 1st July 2016 to 30th June 2017. 

The complete Annual Report is made available to the public and can be downloaded freely from the [BRANZ website](https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/1411349/BRANZ-8th-Annual-Report-Jul-16-Jun-17_0.pdf).
