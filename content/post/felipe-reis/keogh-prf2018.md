In early 2018, I had the pleasure of chatting with **Edmund Keogh**, PhD, from the [Department of Psychology](http://www.bath.ac.uk/departments/department-of-psychology/) at the University of Bath, UK, and [The Bath Centre for Pain Research](http://www.bath.ac.uk/pain/). In the interview we discussed his strong interest in sex and gender differences in pain, and his love of music from the 80's.
