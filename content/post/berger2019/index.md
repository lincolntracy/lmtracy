Working memory refers to the temporary storage and manipulation of information. There is a wide-ranging network throughout our brain involving **frontal and parietal regions** that are responsible for working memory tasks. However, it is not known how the parietal brain regions can communicate with distant prefrontal brain regions (involved in cognitive control) in situations where a high level of cognitive function is required.
