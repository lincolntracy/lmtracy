The dentate gyrus is part of the hippocampus, an area of the brain that plays a critical role in memory formation. The dentate gyrus contains neural stem cells (brain cells that develop into other cell types) as well as a diverse range of other cell types, referred to as niche cells, such as granule cells, mossy cells, and astrocytes. These niche cells can release signals that act on neural stem cells to regulate neurogenesis...
