Towards the end of 2018 I had the great privilege of chatting with Lorimer Moseley, PhD, from the [University of Adelaide](https://people.unisa.edu.au/lorimer.moseley). Lorimer is a Professor in Clinical Neurosciences and is the inaugral Chair in Physiotherapy within the School of Health Sciences.

Lorimer leads the Body in Mind Research Group at the [University of Adelaide](http://u.unisa.edu.au/Research/) and at [Neuroscience Research Australia](https://www.neura.edu.au/) – or NeuRA – in Sydney. He is the Chief Editor of the Body in Mind [blog]( https://bodyinmind.org/), has written [books]( http://www.noigroup.com/en/Product/EPBII), and gave a nifty talk on [why things hurt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwd-wLdIHjs) at TEDxAdelaide.

Along with his research group, Lorimer investigates the role of the brain in chronic pain. He is also has a keen interest in pain education and care in rural communitites. Lorimer understands that chronic pain is a huge burden - and is confident that with a whole of community approach we can flip the way people think and understand pain. He is one of the key figures behind the [Pain Revolution](https://www.painrevolution.org/), which aims to help all Australians access community-based pain education.

During our chat we discussed the need to incorporate modern pain education into the treatment of back pain. In particular, we touched on the [editorial](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2018/07/07/bjsports-2018-099567.long) Lorimer wrote for the British Journal of Sports Medicine in response to a recent [call to action](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)30488-4/fulltext) on the global problem of back pain published in The Lancet.
