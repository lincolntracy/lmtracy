In 2016 I was interviewed by Jackson Peck, a Masters Student in Journalism & International Relations from Monash University. Jackson was writing an article about the challenges associated with undertaking a PhD. 

The full interview can be found on the [Mojonews](http://mojonews.com.au/the-long-hard-road-to-research/) website.
