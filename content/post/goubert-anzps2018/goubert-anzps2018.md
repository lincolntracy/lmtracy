At the 2018 Australian Pain Society 38th and New Zealand Pain Society Conjoint Annual Scientific Meeting I had the privilege to sit down with **Liesbet Goubert**, PhD, from the [Department of Experimental-Clinical and Health Psychology](http://www.ghplab.ugent.be) at Ghent University, Belgium. Liesbet has a strong research interest in the psychosocial resilience mechanisms that may underlie the adaptive functioning and wellbeing in the presence of pain. We discussed her journey into research, her own experience living with chronic pain, and much more.
