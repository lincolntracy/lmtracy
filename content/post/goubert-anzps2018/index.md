*At the 2018 Australian Pain Society 38th and New Zealand Pain Society Conjoint Annual Scientific Meeting I had the privilege to sit down with Liesbet Goubert, PhD, from the [Department of Experimental-Clinical and Health Psychology](http://www.ghplab.ugent.be) at Ghent University, Belgium. Liesbet has a strong research interest in the psychosocial resilience mechanisms that may underlie the adaptive functioning and wellbeing in the presence of pain. We discussed her journey into research, her own experience living with chronic pain, and much more.*

**What first got you interested in science?**

That’s an interesting question. I have two sisters and a brother, but I’m much younger than they are. They were already studying at university when I was a little kid, so I could hear about what they were studying and look through all of their books. I remember when I was 10 years old, and my brother was trying to teach me Einstein’s relativity theory. Even though I’ve forgotten most of what he taught me about that, I was really excited about the opportunity to learn from my sisters and brother. Growing up watching them get their PhDs in areas such as physics and economics got me interested in science from an early age, learning by example.

**How did you become involved in pain research?**

When I was a kid I was interested in medicine and psychology. My interest in medicine originated in childhood mainly because my grandfather was a pediatrician. He died when I was young, but my mother spoke a lot about him and his work after he died, so my interest in medicine was sustained over the years. I was also very interested in psychology from a young age, which made it difficult for me to choose between medicine and psychology for my master’s degree. I eventually decided to study psychology, but I still kept my interest in medicine as well.

During the latter years of my master’s degree we had one or two classes on pain, and that really interested me. Then, during my final year I was contacted by Geert Crombez, who invited me to go on and complete a PhD on pain after my master's. I was really enthusiastic about studying pain, as it was on the edge between psychology and medicine, which was ideal.

We started discussing potential topics and eventually decided on a really interesting proposal that involved clinical studies on pain. I wasn’t interested only in doing experimental research—I wanted to do something that was relevant for the clinic as well. My proposal was funded, and I was able to start my PhD studies under the supervision of Geert. I haven’t regretted it for a moment since then, and still find pain research really fascinating. I love the supportive, multidisciplinary community that I get to work with.

**Much of your recent pain research has focused on psychosocial resilience mechanisms. What made you interested in that?**

Early in my career, as part of my PhD, I had been doing a lot of research on psychosocial risk factors regarding fear and catastrophizing in both adults and children. This was important work, but because there are many individuals without fear-avoidance beliefs who go on to develop chronic pain, it’s not the whole story. There are many people who continue to live their lives despite the presence of pain. In fact, about 8 percent of adults and 20 percent of children report high levels of pain but low levels of disability, so there must be more to it.

I started to think about it more, and since my first pregnancy in 2001 I have been struggling with chronic pain myself due to spondylolisthesis (a slipped disc). I’ve always given a lot of thought to how I can keep things going, because at times it can be really hard. Since my diagnosis I have learned the limits of my own body, and through this I have learned that the key to resilience might be flexible engagement―that is, persisting in activities that you find really important but also maintaining balance and avoiding certain activities at certain times.

It was through this line of thinking that I got interested in the concepts of psychological flexibility, mindfulness, and acceptance and commitment therapy. Someone whom I studied with during my master's, and who now runs his own mindfulness business, started a PhD in our lab some years ago. We struck up a discussion about his work, and he invited me to participate in some of the mindfulness training he runs. I found this to be really helpful on a personal level for the pain I was feeling, but it also really sparked my interest in this as an area of research.

Shortly after this I took six months of sabbatical leave to focus on research, as I had developed quite a strong interest in resilience and wanted to learn more about different perspectives. I went to different conferences, ones without a real focus on pain, and became interested in positive psychology, and in particular the broaden-and-build theory developed by Barbara Fredrickson (this theory suggests that positive emotions broaden one’s awareness and encourages novel and varied thoughts and actions), as well as the self-determination theory (which concerns the motivation behind choices people make that can impact an individual’s actions). These perspectives focus on determinants of adaptive functioning rather than maladaptive functioning and disability.

I’m convinced, as a researcher, that we can learn a lot from people who live with persistent pain but seem to keep functioning well and do not often seek medical attention. There is great potential to learn from these individuals about how they do it—what their resilience mechanisms are. If we can identify these mechanisms, then we can use them to potentially prevent disability in individuals with acute pain, and in multidisciplinary interventions for chronic pain.

**What other projects are you working on now?**

We’re also doing research on couples, where one partner has chronic pain. In this case we are interested in knowing more about what causes the pain-free partner to experience distress, and how different behaviors of the pain-free partner affect the partner with chronic pain. In particular, we have looked at motivational processes for helping behaviors. We assume that the pain-free partner wants to help the patient, but whether or not this is actually helpful for the patient depends on what kind of helping behavior the partner is engaging in, and the type of motivation to provide help.

For instance, partners can help because they feel it’s important, or because they like to help—this is called volitional motivation. But, on the other hand, they can help because they feel forced to—this is called controlled motivation. We have learned that if partners provide help for volitional reasons they then feel so much better for themselves, and their relationship satisfaction is better. There are also positive effects on patients—they feel less pain, they feel more satisfied with the help they receive from their partner, and have more positive affect. So it’s really important that help is provided for the right reasons.

**What’s the most interesting study you have been involved with during your career?**

If I had to choose one, it would be a longitudinal study on pain during medical procedures in children with leukemia. For this study, we recruited children and their parents at diagnosis, and then followed them until the end of treatment about 18 months later. We followed them for every lumbar or bone marrow puncture they received over the course of their treatment. This was challenging, as their tests and treatments were often unpredictable. We asked the children questions about their distress and pain associated with the procedures, and asked the parents about their distress, their sympathy, their behaviors, and about the pain they felt their child was feeling. We also recorded and coded parents’ behaviors before and after each painful procedure.

This was quite a challenging study. It took a number of years to finalize the ethics and legalities surrounding the project. We wanted to film the procedures, but the doctors were very much against that, as they felt that if something went wrong during the procedure then the recording could be used in legal action against them. Eventually we compromised by filming only the preparation phase prior to the puncture, and then immediately afterwards. But it was worth it in the end because the results were really interesting.

We found that parental distress decreased over the course of their child’s treatment, but not in parents who had high levels of catastrophizing immediately after diagnosis. These parents remained very distressed over the duration of their child’s treatment. We also found that the distress of the parents and children were covariates. From this we concluded that it is important to assess the distress of both the child and the parents after the diagnosis, and to immediately start to target it. Otherwise, the parents remain distressed over the course of their child’s treatment and end up transferring their own distress to the child.

**What are the most important things you try to teach the PhD students in your lab?**

I really try to make my PhD students enthusiastic about the research they are doing. Quite often when students start their studies, they are planning on doing clinical work when they finish their PhD. But over the course of their studies I see a number of them really fall in love with research, so I try to help them stay excited about their work and consider research as a viable option post-PhD. However, at the same time, I tell them about what it’s really like to work in research. Although there are points where you will be really happy, there are definitely lots of difficult times, such as when you have a paper or a funding application rejected. So I also teach them how to keep going during the more difficult times.

I also try to be a role model with respect to maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and am open with my strategies on how to do this. Until now, I have only had female PhD students, so I encourage them to take up leadership roles as female academics. Ultimately, I want to be supportive of my students in any way I can, regardless of what they want to do after their PhD. This can range from helping them figure out their career aspirations to writing recommendation letters.

**What is one really important paper you recommend all pain researchers read?**

Although it’s not a paper, the first thing that comes to mind is *Pain: The Science of Suffering*, which was written by Patrick Wall in 1999. This was the first or second book I read when I started working in pain research. Even now I think it’s an amazingly well-written book that tackles a number of issues in the context of pain in an interesting and easy-to-understand manner.

I would also recommend Amanda Williams’ paper, [“Facial expression of pain: an evolutionary account](https://www.painresearchforum.org/papers/99172-facial-expression-pain-evolutionary-account)." It is very interesting to anyone who does research in pain, or works in clinical practice. It’s been a very important paper for me throughout my career.     

**If you could attend a dinner party with anyone from history, dead or alive, whom would you want at the table with you?**

This is slightly off topic, but I had the immense honor of having coffee with Patrick Wall. I was in the last year of my master's researching conflict in romantic relationships. However, I knew that I would be going on to complete my PhD with Geert Crombez at this point in time. Geert asked me to join him and his colleague, Johan Vlaeyen, at a conference in the Netherlands, where they had a meeting set up with Patrick.

It was a really nice meeting and a really interesting conversation—but it wasn’t until a year later that I realized I had been lucky enough to sit down and chat with the Patrick Wall! So that’s quite funny looking back at it now. But to answer the question, I would say Albert Einstein because I think he was a really fascinating person. Or possibly Marie Curie, as I would really love to hear about what it was like being a female academic in the late 19th and early 20th century.
