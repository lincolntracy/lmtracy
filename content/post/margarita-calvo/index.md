Margarita Calvo, MD, PhD, is an associate professor in the Department of Physiology at Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, Santiago. After completing her medical training there, she undertook her PhD in David Bennett’s laboratory at King’s College London, UK. Calvo returned to her alma mater in 2013, where she set up her own lab. Her research follows two lines of investigation: painful small-fiber neuropathy in skin conditions, and the role of voltage-gated potassium channels in counterbalancing hyperexcitability in neuropathic pain. Calvo took time to talk with Lincoln Tracy, a research fellow at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, and a freelance writer, to discuss her research, the pain landscape in Chile, her scientific heroes, and more.
