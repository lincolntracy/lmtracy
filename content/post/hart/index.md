Decision making often requires comparing possible options, such as the amount of effort required to be exerted to achieve the desired outcome. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a part of our brains that plays a role in weighing up the costs of different options prior to making a decision. However, it is not clear how the ACC mediates these cost-benefit evaluations. This week in The Journal of Neuroscience, Hart and colleagues used...
