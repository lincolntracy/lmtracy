*Since July 2017 I have worked as a Research Fellow in the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/), with a particular focus on the Burns Registry of Australia and New Zealand ([BRANZ](http://branz.org/)). In addition to undertaking [research into burn injuries](/project/burninjuries/) I assist in overseeing the collection of epidemiological data on all burn patients admitted to BRANZ hospitals. Each year the BRANZ releases a report, which assists in monitoring burn injury incidence and improving our understanding of burn causation.*

<br/>

The ninth Annual Report from the BRANZ provides valuable information on the incidence and aetiology of burn injury across Australia and New Zealand. Data are presented for 3,459 burns patients treated at 17 specialist burn units over the 12-month period from 1st July 2017 to 30th June 2018. 

The ninth Annual Report has a special focus on burns in older adults. This compliments the theme of the 43rd Annual Scientific meeting of the [Australian and New Zealand Burns Association](https://anzba.org.au/) - "Burns Across the Ages". The meeting be held in Hobart in October 2019. Check out the [meeting website](http://www.anzbaasm.com/hobart) for all the details. I'll be giving a more in-depth talk about [burns in older adults](https://www.lincolntracy.com/talk/anzba2019_olderadults/).  

The complete Annual Report is made available to the public and can be downloaded freely from the [BRANZ website](https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/1870005/BRANZ_AnnualReport_Year9_FINAL.pdf).
