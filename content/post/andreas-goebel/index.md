Andreas Goebel, PhD, is a reader in Pain Medicine, director of the Pain Research Institute, and an Honorary Consultant in Pain Medicine at the University of Liverpool, UK. After training in anesthesia and pain medicine in Germany and the UK, Goebel completed further training in post-trauma immunology at Harvard Medical School, Boston, US. His research focuses on the role of the adaptive immune system in chronic pain. Goebel recently took time to talk with Lincoln Tracy, a research fellow from Monash University, Australia, to discuss his path to post-trauma immunology, developing the concept of autoantibody pain for complex regional pain syndrome, and more. Read on for an edited transcript of their conversation.
