Pain is a subjective experience that cannot be directly measured or quantified. This has spurred the pain fieldâ€™s search for biomarkers: molecules, genes, or other biological factors that could serve as objective, measurable indicators of pain. New research now reveals blood gene expression biomarkers that predict future pain and suggest interesting therapeutic possibilities.

The study, led by Alexander Niculescu, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, US, utilized blood draws from psychiatric patients to discover, prioritize, validate, and test blood gene expression biomarkers that predicted future pain levels...
