**What's the science?**

Learning a new motor skill typically consists of **short periods of active practice**—physically doing the task—**interspersed with short periods of rest**. The combination of practice and rest strengthens the memory in our brain so we can perform the skill better. **Traditionally, the consolidation of a new skill has been thought to occur over a period of hours or days**. This week in [Current Biology](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/home), Bönstrup and colleagues examined the time course of practice and rest in how we learn new motor skills on an unprecedented short time scale.


<br/>
**How did they do it?**

Healthy right-handed individuals were recruited to participate in a two-day study where they **trained and were tested on a procedural motor-skill task** on successive days. The motor task involved pressing keys on a keypad in a **specific sequence of five key presses**. Participants were taught the key press sequence on the first day of the study. They used **their left—or non-dominant—hand to perform the key press sequence** while seeing the sequence on a computer monitor. Participants completed **36 training trials** on the first day. Each trial involved a **10 second period where the participants practiced the key press sequence**, followed by a **10 second rest period**. Participants returned to the laboratory the next day and were tested on their performance on the task. **Nine trials were performed on the testing day**. Throughout both the training and testing days **the brain activity of participants was recorded by [magnetoencephalography](http://ilabs.washington.edu/what-magnetoencephalography-meg)** (MEG) to identify potential brain mechanisms that supported skill learning.


<br/>
**What did they find?**

The authors found that the **early learning of the motor skill was driven by increases in performance between practice periods**. That is, there was a **greater increase in the speed at which participants completed the key press sequences between the end of one trial and the beginning of the next**, rather than over the course of each trial. They also found that this learning was predicted by **oscillating beta-band (16 – 22 Hz) activity in frontoparietal regions of the brain**. Specifically, **downregulation of this oscillating beta-band activity at rest** was identified as the intrinsic neural signature that went along with performance increases in-between trials.

**What's the impact?**

This study is the first to show that a **substantial part of early skill learning occurs while we are at rest**, and that these improvements can be predicted by activity in the frontoparietal region of our brains. These findings **significantly change the way researchers traditionally think about the time it takes us to form a memory and learn new skills**—they show this can occur over a period of seconds, rather than hours or days.
