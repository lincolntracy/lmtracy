Turner syndrome is a genetic condition in females caused by the absence of a part of, or an entire, X chromosome. Women with Turner syndrome have specific cognitive deficits relating to the ability to perceive spatial relationships between objects and the ability to select and monitor goal-related behaviors. Previous research suggests that women and girls with Turner syndrome have structural changes in the parieto-occipital cortex (the part of the brain responsible for the integration of sensory information and the processing of visual information)...
