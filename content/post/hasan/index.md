**What's the science?**

Emotional memory representations or engrams (i.e. memory traces, stored in the brain) such as fear, are critical for survival. These engrams allow both animals and humans to **sense, evaluate, and respond to dangerous situations in an appropriate manner**. Two brain regions involved in the development of fear-related memories—the hypothalamus and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA)—are **connected by oxytocin neurons**. The endogenous hormone **oxytocin may play an important role in modulating fear**, due to its ability to **[modulate the salience of social cues and events](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322315006393)**. However, the exact role of hypothalamic oxytocin neurons in fear conditioning or learning is unknown. This week in Neuron, Hasan and colleagues developed a **novel genetic tagging method**—virus-delivered genetic activity-induced tagging of cell ensembles, or **vGATE**—to tag fear-activated oxytocin neurons in rat brains during fear conditioning.


<br/>
**How did they do it?**

First, the authors developed the novel genetic method **vGATE** in a small subset of hypothalamic oxytocin neurons. This method uses a **c-fos promoter and three different viruses to identify and permanently tag a small subset of neurons with fluorescent proteins**. After confirming that their model worked, they investigated **what proportion of the hypothalamic oxytocin neurons contributed to the anxiolytic effect** and how these neurons were recruited during fear using a fear conditioning paradigm. They then analyzed brain slices to **determine whether the hypothalamic oxytocin neurons projected to the CeA**. The authors also used [optogenetics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/optogenetics)—a technique in which neural activity can be controlled by shining light on the vGATE neurons—to investigate whether fear-related behaviors could be controlled. They used histology and electrophysiology to investigate potential anatomical and molecular changes in the brain following fear experience. Finally, they **introduced a novel context to the fear conditioning paradigm to investigate the role of hypothalamic oxytocin neurons in fear extinction**.

<br/>
**What did they find?**

First, the authors found that **only a small proportion of the hypothalamic oxytocin neurons—approximately 13 percent—were active during the expression of fear**. Second, they found that the majority of **vGATE hypothalamic oxytocin neurons projected to the lateral part of the CeA**. Third, when the vGATE oxytocin neurons were optogenetically simulated with a blue light there was a **substantial reduction in the amount of time the rats were frozen with fear**. Fourth, they found that the **vGATE oxytocin neurons showed increased glutamatergic—but not oxytocinergic—transmission within the medial CeA during fear exposure**. Finally, they found that **inhibiting the vGATE oxytocin neurons exclusively impaired fear extinction**, suggesting that fear extinction involves blocking oxytocin and glutamate mediated neural modulation in the CeA. **These findings suggest that the vGATE oxytocin neurons represent a neuromodulatory memory trace that is a vital contributor to controlling fear-related memories and behaviors**.

**What's the impact?**

This study is the first to demonstrate that **vGATE-assisted hypothalamic oxytocin neurons are adequate to drive fear-related behaviors and are required for extinction of these behaviors**. Importantly, **experiencing fear leads to large amounts of neural plasticity**, bringing about a shift in the lateral CeA from oxytocin signaling to glutamate signaling. These findings have important implications for future investigations of the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie emotion-based mental disorders (such as PTSD) and their potential treatments, including exogenously administered oxytocin and virus-delivered genetically based therapies.
