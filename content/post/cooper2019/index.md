Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mood disorder that is believed to be associated with changes in the brain. Researchers have used magnetic resonance imaging techniques to identify brain-related biomarkers for other conditions such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease. However, brain-related biomarkers have not yet been identified for use in the diagnosis or treatment of MDD. One noninvasive neuroimaging technique used to measure brain function is...
