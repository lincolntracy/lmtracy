Beth Darnall, PhD, is an Associate Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine at Stanford University, USA. Her research examines different ways to best treat and prevent chronic pain, with a specific passion for utilising behavioural medicine strategies to facilitate pain control and opioid reduction. Darnall sat down with Lincoln Tracy, a research fellow from Monash University, Australia, at the 2019 Australian Pain Society Annual Scientific Meeting, which took place April 7-10, 2019, on the Gold Coast, Australia. Darnall discussed her path to pain psychology through journalism, her passion for advocacy, and her fondness of the 1987 album ‘The Joshua Tree’ from Irish rockers U2.
