At the 2018 Australian Pain Society 38th and New Zealand Pain Society Conjoint Annual Scientific Meeting I sat down with **Flavia Di Pietro**, PhD, from the [University of Sydney School of Medicine](http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/). Flavia recently won the [Australian Pain Societyâ€™s](https://www.apsoc.org.au/) Rising Star Award for 2018, which showcases up-and-coming pain researchers in Australia. We discussed her interest in imagining techniques, why it is important for researchers to write for the broader public, and ocean swimming.
