**What's the science?**

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mood disorder that is believed to be associated with changes in the brain. Researchers have used [magnetic resonance imaging](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/magnetic-resonance-imaging) (MRI) techniques to identify brain-related [biomarkers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/biomarkers) for other conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease. However, **brain-related biomarkers have not yet been identified for use in the diagnosis or treatment of MDD**. One noninvasive neuroimaging technique used to measure brain function is [arterial spin labelling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/arterial-spin-labeling) (ASL). In ASL a **magnetic pulse labels blood** before it enters the brain. The amount of labelled blood in each region of the brain can then be quantified; **greater blood flow is typically indicative of greater activity in that brain region**. This week in [Molecular Psychiatry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-019-0464-7), Cooper and colleagues used ASL as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aiming to find brain-related biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of MDD.

<br/>
**How did they do it?**

The authors recruited **200 individuals with MDD** as well as **98 non-depressed individuals** (to act as controls) as part of a clinical trial. All participants underwent a **baseline MRI scan with an ASL sequence** prior to starting their allocated treatment for the trial. The baseline MRI and ASL data was split into **Discovery-Replication** subgroups. The ASL-derived cerebral blood flow (CBF) data from the **Discovery group was used in an exploratory manner** to identify brain regions where CBF differed between MDD and non-depressed individuals. The **Replication group was then used to independently confirm these CBF differences**. The blood flow in regions where CBF differences replicated were then correlated with **clinical features of MDD** (e.g., length of illness, number of MDD episodes, age of MDD onset) to explore **potential relationships between CBF and clinical features**.  

<br/>
**What did they find?**

The Discovery sample showed that **there were differences in CBF between the MDD and control participants**. The MDD participants had **lower CBF** compared to the control participants in **five brain clusters**, and **greater CBF** compared to the control participants in **five brain clusters**. Using the [regions of interest](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/roi-based-processing.html) (ROIs) from the Discovery sample, the Replication sample confirmed **three clusters where CBF was lower in individuals with MDD** compared to the control participants—the **cerebellum and midbrain regions, the right middle temporal gyrus, and the left insula**. The Replication sample also confirmed **three clusters where CBF was greater in individuals with MDD** compared to the control participants—the **left anterior prefrontal and dorsolateral cortices, the right inferior parietal lobule, and the left inferior parietal lobule**. The **CBF of several replicated ROIs were correlated with the clinical features of MDD**. For example, the decreased CBF within the left insula negatively correlated with the length of illness. That is, **a longer length of illness in individuals with MDD was associated with lower perfusion within the left insula**.

<br/>
**What's the impact?**

This study is the first to **discover and provide unbiased confirmation of CBF differences in a large population of individuals with MDD**. These are important and exciting findings for this field of research as there has previously been a lack of discovery-replication work. These findings **suggest that CBF could serve as a potential marker for the long-term effects of MDD** and may also serve as a potential mediator of responses to treatment. **These findings also have implications for future studies aimed at developing CBF as a biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of MDD and other clinical populations**.
