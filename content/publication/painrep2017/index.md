abstract = "Over the past 20 years, our understanding of social factors on pain experience has increased. Edwards et al. observed that the presence of a friend resulted in an increased pain threshold and tolerance to experimentally induced pain (cold pressor test and pressure algometry). Having a male friend present had the most prominent effect on male participants' reporting of pain. However, the effects of psychosocial traits known to effect pain experience (eg, catastrophising) were not considered."
