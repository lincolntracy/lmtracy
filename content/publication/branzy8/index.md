abstract = "This is the eighth annual report of the Burns Registry of Australia and New Zealand (BRANZ). Data collected between the 1st July 2016 and 30th June 2017 (Year 8) is summarised in this report. All 17 BRANZ sites (13 Australian sites and 4 New Zealand sites) contributed data with 3,295 cases entered. <br/> <br/> The report describes the registry, as well as the profile, treatment and outcomes of burns unit admissions from 1st July 2016 to 30th June 2017. Quality of care data related to processes of care is also provided. Where appropriate, data has been compared to previous annual report periods. Data has also been compared with the American Burn Associationâ€™s National Burn Repository (NBR) 2016 report of data from 2006 to 2015, as that the NBR reports comparable summary data."
