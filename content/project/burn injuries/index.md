Approximately 3,000 people present to specialist burns units in Australia and New Zealand each year with burn injuries. Epidemiological, quality of care, and outcome data for these patients in then entered into the [Burns Registry of Australia and New Zealand](https://branz.org/) (BRANZ). 

My research in this area uses data from the BRANZ. I am currently undertaking projects investigating:

- Predictors of unplanned readmissions following burn injury
- The prevalence of pain assessment following burn injury 
- The characteristics of patients with inhalation injuries in Australia and New Zealand, and estimating the impact of inhalation injury on clinical outcomes
- The prevalence and predictors of itch, pain, and patient-reported outcomes to 12-months post-burn
- Variation in practice between Australian and New Zealand burns units, and establishing if and how this variation impacts patient outcomes
- Differences in the characteristics of paients treated in burns centres in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States
