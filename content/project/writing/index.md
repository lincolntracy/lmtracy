For the past few years I have written and conducted interviews for the Pain Research Forum, RELIEF, and the Australian Pain Society Newsletter. 

My interest in writing and science communication has been inspired by many sources, including my time at the [North American Pain School](https://www.lincolntracy.com/post/napswriteup/), my involvement in [Fresh Science](https://www.lincolntracy.com/post/freshscience-2018/), and people such as [Dan Quintana](https://www.dsquintana.com/), [James Heathers](http://jamesheathers.com/), and [Nate Fried](http://www.neuronate.com/).
