For the past few years I have written and conducted interviews for the Pain Research Forum, RELIEF, BrainPost, and the Australian Pain Society Newsletter. 

My interest in writing and science communication has been inspired by many sources, including my time at the [North American Pain School](https://www.lincolntracy.com/post/napswriteup/), my involvement in [Fresh Science](https://www.lincolntracy.com/post/freshscience-2018/), and people such as [Dan Quintana](https://www.dsquintana.com/), [James Heathers](http://jamesheathers.com/), and [Nate Fried](http://www.neuronate.com/).

**Pain Research Forum**

[Pain Research Forum](https://www.painresearchforum.org/) is an interactive web community for investigators in academia, industry, medicine, and other fields who are working to translate basic neurobiology into new treatments for chronic pain. PRF aims to speed the rendering of new knowledge into novel therapies by improving information sharing between labs and the clinic, by fostering new collaborations among researchers, and by raising interest in pain research among a wider community of scientists and clinicians.
