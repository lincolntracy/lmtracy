Pain is a fascinating phenomenon. In an acute sense, it serves as an alarm or warning signal of potential or actual damage. However when pain becomes chronic, the protective aspect is lost and the resulting pain can be severly disabling. Researchers have recently proposed to update the definition of pain to include the cognitive and social components that contribute to its experience. I am interested in using techniques such as [heart rate variability](/project/hrv) to investigate pain from a social and affective perspective.
