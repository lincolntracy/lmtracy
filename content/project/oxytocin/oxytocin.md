There is growing evidence to suggest that the neuropeptide hormone oxytocin plays an important role in the modulation of both social and non-social cognition and behaviour. However, oxytocin is more than just the a "social" peptide, as it (and the closely related peptide vasopressin) is also involved in regulating a number of different physiological systems.

My research in this area explores the potential modulatory effects of oxytocin on the perception and experience of pain in healthy people, and people living with chronic pain. Improving our understanding of how oxytocin influences pain can help identify potential novel treatment approaches.
